                    <h2>Kenny's Bar</h2>
                    <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NRoDWDkwYPof4ubj8">〒170-0014 Tokyo, Toshima City, Ikebukuro, 2 Chome−1−3 大福ビル 3F</a>
                    <p>Kenny’s Bar is by far the hippest place in not-so-hip Ikebukuro. It’s a small, dark joint with superb speakers and occasional live gigs. Many bonus points for the super-cool Mingus and Coltrane posters up in there, and for Kenny (Katakura-san) himself being so welcoming. Lots of hard-bop classics on the stereo and good chat sitting at the bar. One of my favorite places in town for a beer and some good music.</p>

                    <h2>Paper Moon</h2>
                    <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WbwdyjuDZsUf95SQ7"> Umimoto Bldg (梅本) , 4F, 3-29-2 Nishi-Ikebukuro</a>
                    <p>Paper Moon (ぺーぱーむーん) is a 15 seat L-shaped counter bar opened and run by the friendly Yamamoto-san since 1982..and except for the cds scattered around the place the decor or furniture doesn’t seem to have changed since ’82. And that’s a good thing, I like my jazz bars to have soul and to feel lived in.

                    Yamamoto-san plays a wide range of music here, from free to Latin to local Japanese musicians. The beer was cold and you can bottle-keep if you want to be a regular. The window was open and the lights were kept fairly low, just a perfect spot for night-time drinking and jazz listening. Paper Moon is classic, one of my favorite places in town, and no table charge makes it just about perfect. Warning: not for people who are put off by a bit of dust.</p>

                    <h2>Absolute Blue</h2>
                    <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qy1pvRndfgBMn5Sa7">Toshima-Ku, Nishi-Ikebukuro, 1-15-6, Toshima Kaikan B2F</a>
                    <p>Absolute Blue is a new club opened in Feb 2015 by Ayumi Hoshikawa, previously a club owner in New York City. Hoshikawa-san has brought a NYC sensibility to her new venue (see the website) including not only nightly live performances but workshops and jam sessions as well.

                        Ex-Brand New Heavies vocalist N’Dea Davenport does Sunday afternoon vocal lessons, local bassist Derek Short hosts twice monthly jam nights and well known bassist Kenji Hino does bass lessons and also performs regularly in a duo with Takashi Sugawa.
                        
                        Hoshikawa-san speaks excellent English and is making a real strong effort to make her club a spot for both Japanese and visiting foreign musicians to gather and perform. It’s a basement space quite far underground but looks sleek, with all seats close to the stage.  I’m hoping she can keep it going as Absolute Blue is a welcome new addition to the live jazz scene.</p>
